In this project, a movie ratings dataset was analyzed to extract meaningful insights.
The data included movie titles, genres, and ratings.

**The process involved:**

Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset

Checking for missing values and data consistency

Calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, and mode

Visualizing rating distributions using histograms and box plots

Identifying top-rated movies and genres

A simple dashboard-style visualization was created using Python plots to present key findings.

**Results & Interpretation**

The average movie rating indicated generally positive audience feedback.

The histogram showed that most movie ratings were clustered at the higher end.

The box plot confirmed minimal outliers in the dataset.

Top-rated movies were identified based on highest ratings.

Genre analysis showed that certain genres consistently received higher average ratings.

📌 Conclusion:
This project demonstrated the ability to turn raw data into insights that can support decision-making, similar to real-world business and entertainment analytics scenarios.
